# Code of Conduct

## About the Project

The **Smartly Darija NLP Project** is an open-source initiative aimed at building a high-quality multilingual dataset for the Moroccan dialect, **Darija**. This dataset bridges **Darija** (in Arabic script and Arabizi), **Modern Standard Arabic**, and **English** to support innovative natural language processing (NLP) solutions.

Our community is a collaborative space where contributors of all backgrounds can work together to advance linguistic research while respecting and valuing Moroccan cultural diversity.
