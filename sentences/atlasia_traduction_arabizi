"2 eggs, mix them with a cup of semolina well, add a quarter cup of oil and mix until it disappears, and mix, and add two cups of thick yogurt. And add two cups of semolina, and you can add one quarter cup depending on whether the semolina absorbs or not, and put baking powder and a little vinegar, approximately half a small spoon, if you don't have it, it's okay. And add lemon zest, optional, but it gives a wonderful taste, and enjoy. Grease the mold with a little oil and sprinkle it with semolina and empty the mixture. The oven should be medium, put it on top until it is cooked, then lower it to brown, and be careful because it browns quickly, and decorate as you like with crushed cocoa or cake.

"My dear beloved sister, peace be upon you. If you know of any family in Fez, I can come and work for them, doing laundry, cooking, and taking care of the children. I won't go out until I've finished everything. I'll work for just a dirham or if you give me just a little bit of vegetables and oil from their house. I have two daughters, one of whom was just born. I am taking full responsibility. I swear to God, I am writing this while crying. God is high and aware of our situation. The neighbors gave me Wi-Fi so I can look for small jobs on the phone, but the signal is very weak. We were well off until times turned against us. I want to work for her doing anything, even if it's just a little help with vegetables or a can of milk. My daughter is suffering from anemia due to a lack of potatoes and almonds in her diet. Please don't ignore me. If anyone has any used items or knows of any charities for divorced women or any work in agriculture, as long as it's halal, may God protect you in this world and the hereafter and give you a palace in paradise. Don't ignore me, even if it's just a prayer for good without shaming me. What I'm going through is enough. For the sake of my children, I would bury my face in the dirt. Only those who have gone through this will understand me. 🤲🏻🙏",ﺧﺘﻲ ﻟﺤﺒﻴﺒﺔ ﺳﻠﻢ ﻋﻠﻴﻜﻢ ﻟﻜﻴﻌﺮﻑ ﺷﻲ ﻋﺎﺀﻟﺔ ﻓﺎﺱ ﻧﺠﻲ ﻧﺸﻘﺎ ﻟﻴﻬﺎ ﻭﺗﺼﺒﺎﻥ ﻭﻃﻴﺎﺏ ﻭﻧﻘﺎﺑﻞ ﻟﻮﻻﺩ ﻟﻲ ﻛﺎﻥ ﻣﻨﺨﺮﺝ ﺗﺎ ﻧﺴﺎﻟﻲ ﻛﻮﻟﺸﻲ ﻧﺨﺪﻡ ﻏﻲ ﺩﺭﻫﻢهم ﺍﻭ ﺗﻌﻄﻴﻨﻲ ﻏﻲ ﺷﻮﻳﺎ ﺩﻳﺎﻝ ﺍﻟﺨﻀﺮﺓ ﻭﺯﻳﺖ ﻣﻦ ﺩﺍﺭﻫﺎ ﻋﻨﺪﻱ ﺟﻮﺝ ﻭﻟﻴﺪﺍﺕ ﺑﻨﻴﺔ ﻋﺎﺩ ﺧﻼﻗﺖ ﺍﻧﺎ ﻫﺎﺯﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺲﺀﻭﻟﻴﺔ ﻛﺎﻣﻠﺔ ﺍﻗﺴﻢ ﺑﺎﻟﻠﻪ ﺍﻻ ﻛﻨﻜﺘﺐ ﻭﻧﺒﻜﻲ ﺭﺑﻲ ﻋﺎﻟﻲ ﻭﻋﺎﻟﻢ ﺑﺤﺎﻟﺘﻨﺎ ﺟﻴﺮﺍﻥ ﻋﻄﻴﻨﻲ ﻟﻮﻳﻔﻲ ﺑﺎﺵ ﻛﻨﻘﻠﺐ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺑﺮﻳﻜﻮﻻﺕ ﻣﻦ ﺗﻠﻔﻦ ﻭﻟﻜﻦ ﻗﻼﻝ ﺑﺰﺍﻑ ﻛﻨﺎ ﺑﻴﺨﻴﺮ ﺣﺘﺎ ﺗﻘﻠﺐ ﺯﻣﺎﻥ ﻋﻠﻴﻨﺎ ﺑﻐﺎﺕ ﻧﺨﺪﻣﻠﻬﺎ ﺍﻱ ﺣﺎﺟﺔ ﺗﻌﻮﻧﻲ ﻏﻴﺮ ﺷﻮﻳﺎ ﺩﻳﺎﻝ ﺍﻟﺨﻀﺮﺓ ﻭﻻ ﻃﻮﻳﺴﺔ ﺣﻠﻴﺐ ﺑﻨﺘﻲ ﻗﻬﺮﺗﻬﺎ ﺑﺎﺗﺎﻱ ﻭﻟﻮﻳﺰﺓ ﻓﺮﺿﺎﻋﺔ ﻣﺮﺿﺎﺗﻠﻲ ﺑﻔﻘﺮ ﺍﻟﺪﻡ ﺍﻟﻌﺎﺭ ﻣﺘﺘﺠﻬﻠﻮﻧﻴﺶ ﻭﻟﻲ ﻋﻨﺪﻭ ﺷﻲ ﺣﻮﻳﺠﺎﺕ ﻗﺪﺍﻡ ﻭﻻ ﺷﻲ ﺟﻤﻌﻴﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﻄﻠﻘﺎﺕ ﻭﻻ ﺷﻲ ﺧﺪﻣﺔ ﻓﻲ ﻟﻔﻼﺣﺔ ﻛﻴﻤﺎ ﻛﺎﻧﺖ ﻏﻲ ﺗﻜﻮﻥ ﺣﻼﻝ ﷲ ﻳﺴﺘﺮﻙ ﺩﻧﻴﺎ ﻭﺍﺧﺮﺓ ﻭﻳﻌﻄﻴﻜﻢ ﻗﺴﺮ ﻓﺠﻨﺔ ﻣﺘﺘﺠﻬﻠﻮﻧﻴﺶ ﻭﺍﺧﺎ ﻏﻲ ﺩﻋﻴﻮﺓ ﺍﻟﺨﻴﺮ ﺑﻼ ﻣﺘﻌﻴﺮﻭﻧﻲ ﻟﻲ ﻓﻲ ﻛﺎﻓﻴﻨﻲ ﻋﻼ ﻭﺩ ﻭﻻﺩﻱ ﻧﺨﺸﻲ ﻭﺟﻬﻲ ﻓﺘﺮﺍﺏ ﻏﻴﺤﺴﻮ ﺑﻲ ﻏﻲ ﻟﻲ ﻣﺪﻭﺯﻳﻦ ﻫﺪﺷﻲ 🤲 🏻 🙏 ﻟﻈﻈﺰ .

Now, thank God, I have learned a lot from you and you have become my go-to whenever I need a recipe. I go to your channel because I know that your recipes work for me from the first try... I am a fan of baklava, especially with cocoa. My children and I prefer cocoa over almonds. It's just that the Turks have it very expensive, pistachios I think more than in Morocco. Anyway, it's even more expensive here, it sells for 350 dirhams per kilo all over Turkey. I follow a lot of videos of people filming in Turkey and all those who filmed the markets or dried fruit shops have put the dirham, meaning it's expensive. But they also sell it expensively because they sell a kilo of baklava for about 200 dirhams or more.",ﺍﺧﺘﻲ ﺣﻠﻴﻤﻪ ﺍﻭﻻ ﺟﺰﺍﻛﻲ ﷲ ﺧﻴﺮﺍ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻣﺎ ﻛﺘﻘﺪﻣﻴﻠﻨﺎ ﺍﻧﺎ ﻣﻦ ﺍﻟﻨﺎﺱ ﻟﻲ ﺗﻌﻠﻤﻮ ﻣﻨﻚ ﺑﺰﺍﻑ ﺣﻴﺖ ﺗﺰﻭﺟﺖ ﻭﻓﻔﺮﻧﺴﺎ ﻭﻣﻜﻨﺖ ﻧﻌﺮﻑ ﻭﺍﻟﻮ ﻓﺎﻟﻄﺒﺦ ﺩﺍﺑﺎ ﺍﻟﺤﻤﺪ ﻟﻠﻪ ﺗﻌﻠﻤﺖ ﻣﻨﻚ ﺑﺰﺍﻑ ﻭﻟﻴﺘﻲ ﻣﻌﺘﻤﺪﻩ ﻋﻨﺪﻱ ﻛﻠﻤﺎ ﺍﺣﺘﺎﺟﻴﺖ ﻟﺸﻲ ﺍﻛﻠﻪ ﻛﻨﺪﺧﻞ ﻟﻘﻨﺎﺗﻚ ﺣﻴﺖ ﻋﺎﺭﻓﻪ ﺍﻥ ﻭﺻﻔﺎﺗﻚ ﻛﻴﻨﺠﺤﻮﻟﻲ ﻣﻦ ﺍﻭﻝ ﻣﺮﻩ . . . ﻭﺍﻧﺎ ﻣﻦ ﻋﺸﺎﻕ ﺍﻟﺒﻘﻼﻭﺓ ﺑﺎﻟﺨﺼﻮﺹ ﺑﺎﻟﻜﺎﻭﻛﺎﻭ ﺍﻧﺎ ﻧﻔﺲ ﺍﻟﺸﻲ ﺍﻧﺎ ﻭﻭﻻﺩﻱ ﻛﻨﻔﻀﻠﻮ ﺍﻟﻜﺎﻛﺎﻭ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻠﻮﺯ ﻏﻲ ﻫﻤﺎ ﺍﻷﺗﺮﺍﻙ ﻋﻨﺪﻫﻢ ﻏﺎﻟﻲ ﺑﺰﺍﻑ ﻟﺒﻴﺴﺘﺎﺵ ﻧﻈﻦ ﺍﻛﺜﺮ ﻣﻦ ﺍﻟﻤﻐﺮﺏ ﺍﻟﻤﻬﻢ ﺑﻌﺪﺍ ﺍﻛﺜﺮ ﻣﻦ ﻫﻨﺎ ﻛﻴﺘﺒﺎﻉ 350 ﺩﺭﻫﻢ ﻟﻠﻜﻴﻠﻮ ﻓﺘﺮﻛﻴﺎ ﻛﻠﻬﺎ ﺣﻴﺖ ﺍﻧﺎ ﻛﻨﺘﺎﺑﻊ ﺑﺰﺍﻑ ﻓﻴﺪﻳﻮﻫﺎﺕ ﺍﻟﻨﺎﺱ ﻟﻲ ﻛﻴﺼﻮﺭﻭ ﻓﺘﺮﻛﻴﺎ ﻭﻛﻞ ﺍﻟﻠﻲ ﺻﻮﺭﻭ ﺍﻷﺳﻮﺍﻕ ﻭﻻ ﺍﻟﻤﺤﻼﺕ ﺩﻳﺎﻝ ﺍﻟﻔﻮﺍﻛﻪ ﺍﻟﺠﺎﻓﻪ ﺩﺍﻳﺮﻳﻦ ﺩﺭﻫﻢرهم ﻳﻌﻨﻲ ﻏﺎﻟﻲ ﻭﻟﻜﻦ ﺣﺘﻰ ﻫﻤﺎ ﻛﻴﺒﻴﻌﻮﻫﺎ ﻏﺎﻟﻴﻪ ﺣﻴﺖ ﻛﻴﺒﻴﻌﻮ ﻛﻴﻠﻮ ﺑﻘﻼﻭﺓ ﺑﺸﻲ 200 ﺩﺭﻫﻢ ﻭﻻ ﺍﻛﺜﺮ
