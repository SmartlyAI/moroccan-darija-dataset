# Smartly Darija NLP Project

Welcome to the **Smartly Darija NLP Project**, an ambitious open-source initiative by **Smartly.ai**, dedicated to the Moroccan dialect, **Darija**.

## 📌 Project Objective

This project aims to collect, organize, and develop a powerful multilingual dataset that bridges:

- **Darija** (written in Arabic script and Latin transcription, *Arabizi*),
- **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)**, and
- **English**,

### 🌟 Example
**User Input:**  
`كيفاش نبدل كلمة السر؟`

**Expected Output:**  
`باش تبدل كلمة السر، سير ل'نسيت كلمة السر' وبدل.`

## 🌍 Vision

This dataset will serve as the foundation for developing an **intelligent chatbot** capable of:

- Understanding **natural Darija**.
- Identifying the context of questions.
- Delivering **precise and tailored** responses.

By highlighting the richness and diversity of Moroccan culture, we aim to lay the groundwork for innovative **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** solutions.
